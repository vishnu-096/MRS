# MRS

In master branch : Run the exploration_mrs.py file to run the explorations. Different settings are possible by changing parameters in global_map(for obstacles and features to detect).


In working branch: simulation.py  file will execute the robot motion simultaneously. "nmpc" flag needs to be set to use mpc based navigation.
